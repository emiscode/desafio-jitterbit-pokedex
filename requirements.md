# Requirements

Develop two applications: one using Angular, and the other one using NodeJs. Do so in a way that the Angular application will be able to call APIs from the NodeJs application. The APIs made in NodeJs must make calls to the PokéAPI REST API (https://pokeapi.co/), in order to implement a list and information pages of Pokémons (similar to a Pokédex).

## Minimum features

- List of Pokémon: initial screen of the application. You must list a fixed number of Pokémons in the initial load and keep adding more Pokémons if the user decides to click the “Load More” button. You can decide how many Pokémons will be initially loaded
- “Load More” button: load more Pokémons on the screen
- Search: add an input to allow the user to search for Pokémons (query
  Pokémon based on their names)
- Select Pokémon: create a details page to view additional details for a selected Pokémon

## Additional features (optional)

- Create unit tests with Jest to cover some features of the project.
- Configure your project to run in Docker containers
